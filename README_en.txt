##Movielens Dataset

GroupLens Research has collected and proposes several sizes of datasets relating to movies and ratings. The
main target is to study and develop a movie recommender system, to facilitate choices. “Movielens”, from
GroupLens, is a website which helps people to find movies to watch.

The Movielens 10M dataset, used in our project, contains ten millions ratings, for about 10000 movies and
72000 users. The dataset is divided into training and test set. The training set holds 90% of the total
dataset.

In the training set, we have 10677 movies, for 69878 users.

The goal of our project is to develop a model, based on datas in the training set, which is able to predict a
rating, for a specific film and identified user.

In the end of the project, the model is used with the test set, and performance is evaluate with RMSE
(residual mean squared error).

There are five main parts in the following, which represents the principal tasks performed for the project :
• Data cleaning
• Data exploration (general information, graphical representations, analysis of stand alone effects)
• First results
• Models evaluation
• Results section
